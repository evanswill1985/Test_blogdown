This site provides you with important information regarding the **MOVEMORE trial**. The **MOVEMORE trial** stands for Monitoring Objective Variations in Everyday Movement and Osteogenic Bone Loads in Response to Bariatric Surgery. The study is a collaboration between researchers at the University of Sunderland and surgeons at the Bariatric Unit.   

# What is the study about? 

The **MOVEMORE trial** will monitor daily physical activity (e.g., walking) levels prior to and up to one year following your weight-loss surgery. The information collected as part of the trial will provide researchers with insight into how much your physical activity levels change as a consequence of surgery - this information will be used to inform future research projects.
